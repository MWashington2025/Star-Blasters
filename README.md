  application's terminal Within the "Display" public class, the code will run through all and display 
  all the functions inputted through the code

  Now for this entire java class (Menu), it's just like the previous four java classes, 
  except it extends off of the "Display" java class and all the information is shown to a user 
  as a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of displaying in the application's terminal

  This java class focuses on giving the user the ability to search, update, add, remove, and display for 
  information (in this case player's info) within the application's terminal Within this class also, 
  when the user tries to search for players, the code will display a message depending on if the player 
  entered by the user is within the system
